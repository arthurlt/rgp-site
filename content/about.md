# The Train Box
We propose a ‘Train Box’ for downtown Salt Lake City, which is just what it sounds like: a big concrete box, dug down into the ground, that is big enough to hold multiple railroad tracks. Many such structures exist in the United States, most famously in Reno, NV (2 miles long), and Los Angeles (10 miles long). 

With tracks below-ground, 8 deadly at-grade crossings could be closed. Rail Service could return to the Rio Grande Depot, which served as the city’s main rail hub until 1999, when the tracks were pulled up. Multiple road bridges could be reduced in length or completely eliminated, allowing east and west Salt Lake City to reunite in a way they have not been able to ever since the tracks first arrived in the 1870’s. Most importantly, the 50 acres of land currently occupied by the rail yards west of town could be redeveloped into a new urban neighborhood; this new development would potentially be enough to pay off the cost of constructing the box in the first place, making the Rio Grande Plan entirely self-funding.

# The Future of Transit
The Rio Grande Plan is the first step towards a more comprehensive downtown rail transit network. Salt Lake City is already well-served by three light rail lines. The Rio Grande Depot is well positioned to fit into the existing routes and help the transit system expand further west to encompass all of downtown. Walkability is also a major draw for the downtown area. Salt Lake Central Station is currently too far from the rest of downtown to be reached on foot alone. The Rio Grande Depot, however, is within walking distance of most major downtown destinations. More people engaging in active transportation will bring greater activity on the streets and sidewalks, bringing much-needed street life back to Salt Lake City.
