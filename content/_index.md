# Welcome to the Rio Grande Plan

A Citizen Proposal to Restore Rail Service to the Rio Grande Depot and reconnect our divided community

## What is the Rio Grande Plan

The Rio Grande Plan began as a citizen-driven vision for removing railroad crossings, revitalizing a neighborhood, and reusing the historic Rio Grande Depot as Salt Lake City’s main transit hub. Since it was originally pitched in 2020, real steps have been taken by Salt Lake City to study and explore the Rio Grande Plan and its potential.

## Rio Grande Plan Economic Impact Analysis

Led by Pedram Jahingary, Huntsman School of Business 2024 Teacher of the Year and the Eldon J. Gardner Utah State University Teacher of The Year, USU students Curtis Bishop and Troy Wissenbach utilized IMPLAN economic modeling software to compare findings from the Salt Lake City-commissioned Rio Grande Concept Plan Screening Analysis, which determined both the feasibility of the Rio Grande Plan and outlined 75 acres of underutilized rail yards with potential for redevelopment.

## Rio Grande Plan Screening Analysis

Before including the Rio Grande Plan in the ‘Reconnecting Communities’ study, Salt Lake City wanted to have a realistic, coordinated version of the Rio Grande Plan on hand. Kimley Horn, an established engineering consultant, was tasked with contacting local stakeholders, including the host railroads, in order to understand their needs and design requirements. A preliminary cost estimate was also prepared.

## Rio Grande Plan Financing and Economic Development Strategies

The Rio Grande Plan has risen to a place of serious consideration, with a preliminary endorsement from the Salt Lake County Council and various local advocacy and community councils in Salt Lake City and the state. The Rio Grande Plan Financing and Economic Development Strategy (RGP- FEDS) details potential funding sources including discretionary grants from the federal Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, federal loans and credits via the US Department of Transportation (USDOT), private contributions, as well as state and local bonds). The document draws on examples from similar successfully-funded projects in neighboring states and provides a budget template to receive similar funding as project peers.

## SLC West-East Connections Study

In February 2023, Salt Lake City was awarded nearly $2 million from the United States Department of Transportation in order to study solutions for eliminating barriers caused by transportation infrastructure. One of the principal options being studied is the Rio Grande Plan’s concept of a ‘train box,’ which would move all railroad tracks into a below-grade trench.
