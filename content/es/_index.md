  FrontRunner, Amtrak, and Union Pacific activity downtown would be **completely grade separated**  

  The trains would run **unconflicted** in a covered trench (train box) beneath 500 West, which could be used as a street again  

  **Zero demolition** of housing units would be required

  Over **75 acres** of downtown-adjacent land would be **opened for redevelopment**  

  The taxable value of these parcels would increase from $17 million to **$2 billion**  

  **Another 50 acres** would be revitalized by increased access and proximity  

  An **entire new city district** could be built with over **2600 housing units**, new green spaces, offices, hotels, entertainment venues, university facilities, a permanent public market, churches, and more  

  This would be the most transit-oriented development opportunity **in state history**

  Passenger rail service would be **restored** to the Rio Grande Depot  

  Utah and the Intermountain West would have the **world-class**, modern train station it deserves  

  The new station would be capable of **comfortably** hosting new routes to Boise and Las Vegas
